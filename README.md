📊 HR Attrition Analysis – Tableau Project
🔎 Problem Statement

Employee attrition is one of the biggest challenges for organizations. High attrition rates not only increase recruitment costs but also affect productivity and morale.
The goal of this project is to analyze employee data and uncover insights into the factors contributing to attrition.

🛠️ What I Did

Collected and used HR data (Excel dataset).

Built an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze employee attrition.

Identified patterns such as:

Attrition by age, gender, and department.

The impact of job role, education, and salary on attrition.

Insights on work-life balance and years at company.

Designed visualizations to make findings easy to interpret for HR teams and management.
